# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
## Details
      By Alexandre Gautier          Weight: 2          Project to be done in teams of 2 people                Ongoing project - started 02-10-2022, must end by 02-16-2022 (in 4 days)          - you're done with 0% of tasks.              Checker will be released at 02-13-2022 12:00 AM              An auto review will be launched at the deadline       ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/248/willy-wonka.png) 

## Background Context
This project is meant to be done by groups of two students. Each group of two should  [pair program](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/QcXizPyNa4DTAMLNzCwdHg) 
  for at least the mandatory part.
## Resources
Read or watch :
* [Sorting algorithm](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/tmzgO7xhCpNgPUxVhLKibw) 

* [Big O notation](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/XrLMaOhUMHfwsFEz15TVow) 

* [Sorting algorithms animations](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/kJ7rgWoqdLnxSnSEoAiFCQ) 

* [15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/RdvoGNMTJ6Hq34aJ_HmCqA) 
 (WARNING: The following video can trigger seizure/epilepsy. It is not required for the project, as it is only a funny visualization of different sorting algorithms)
## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to  [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/NwGzC3ck-xCcOmVIIbZn9Q) 
 ,  without the help of Google :
### General
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm
## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors:  ` vi ` ,  ` vim ` ,  ` emacs ` 
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A  ` README.md `  file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the  ` Betty `  style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) 
 and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl) 

* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, … is totally forbidden.
* In the following examples, the  ` main.c `  files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own  ` main.c `  files at compilation. Our  ` main.c `  files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called  ` sort.h ` 
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.
### GitHub
There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.
## More Info
### Data Structure and Functions
* For this project you are given the following  ` print_array ` , and  ` print_list `  functions:
```bash
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * print_array - Prints an array of integers
 *
 * @array: The array to be printed
 * @size: Number of elements in @array
 */
void print_array(const int *array, size_t size)
{
    size_t i;

    i = 0;
    while (array && i < size)
    {
        if (i > 0)
            printf(", ");
        printf("%d", array[i]);
        ++i;
    }
    printf("\n");
}

```
```bash
#include <stdio.h>
#include "sort.h"

/**
 * print_list - Prints a list of integers
 *
 * @list: The list to be printed
 */
void print_list(const listint_t *list)
{
    int i;

    i = 0;
    while (list)
    {
        if (i > 0)
            printf(", ");
        printf("%d", list->n);
        ++i;
        list = list->next;
    }
    printf("\n");
}

```
* Our files  ` print_array.c `  and  ` print_list.c `  (containing the  ` print_array `  and  ` print_list `  functions) will be compiled with your functions during the correction.
* Please declare the prototype of the functions  ` print_array `  and  ` print_list `  in your  ` sort.h `  header file
* Please use the following data structure for doubly linked list:
```bash
/**
 * struct listint_s - Doubly linked list node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @prev: Pointer to the previous element of the list
 * @next: Pointer to the next element of the list
 */
typedef struct listint_s
{
    const int n;
    struct listint_s *prev;
    struct listint_s *next;
} listint_t;

```
Please, note this format is used for Quiz and Task questions.
*  ` O(1) ` 
*  ` O(n) ` 
*  ` O(n!) ` 
* n square ->  ` O(n^2) ` 
* log(n) ->  ` O(log(n)) ` 
* n * log(n) ->  ` O(nlog(n)) ` 
* n + k ->  ` O(n+k) ` 
* …
Please use the “short” notation (don’t use constants). Example:   ` O(nk) `   or   ` O(wn) `   should be written   ` O(n) `  .If an answer is required within a file, all your answers files must have a newline at the end.
### Tests
Here is a quick tip to help you test your sorting algorithms with big sets of random integers:  [Random.org](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/KkFXByKWf55lTK32JnY62w)
